                <h3 id="key-feature-header">You are trapped and surrounded</h3>
                <p>
                    The dark forces from the Nether Realm, aided by heretics from our own ranks, have invaded our home. In the time that followed, you fought long and hard to survive the cruelty this world has become. After humanity's final stand at the gates of the mysterious maze, you broke through, determined to finish the fight and claim victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blessed with powers that drain the life force of fallen enemies, you find yourself trapped within the maze. Yet, you gather your strength, knowing this battle is your last hope for humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you fight through the twisting corridors, cutting down demons and their treacherous human allies, seeking to deliver justice and vengeance. Only by severing the heads of those who threaten your people can you hope to conquer the horrors of the Nether Realm and its heretic conspirators.
                    <strong>Claim Victory for Humanity!</strong>

                    Experience the maze from a first-person perspective, fully immersing you in the role of the maze walker. With advanced raycasting technology, the environment comes alive as you navigate twisting corridors. The maze isn't just a setting—it's a living, breathing entity that surrounds you, drawing you into its dark and mysterious depths.

                <p>
                    Your survival hinges on mastering the life-drain mechanic. Each enemy you face isn't just an obstacle—they are your lifeline. Defeating them allows you to siphon their life force, healing your wounds and giving you the strength to press on. The greater the foe’s strength, the more health you recover. It’s a brutal cycle of fight or perish.

                <p>
                    The enemies of the Nether Realm are relentless and cunning, powered by advanced AI algorithms. They react to your presence the moment they spot you, tracking your movements with predatory precision. There’s no corner of the maze where you can truly hide—once you’ve been detected, they will pursue you relentlessly, forcing you to fight them or be overwhelmed.

                <p>
                    For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved playing video games. I’ve explored many genres, but my favorites have always been First Person Shooters like DOOM and Role-Playing Games like The Witcher 3. I’ve often wondered what it would take to create a game of my own, and this project represents the first steps in that journey. My main inspiration comes from DOOM (2016) and Wolfenstein 3D. Wolfenstein 3D uses raycasting to simulate a 3D environment on a 2D map, which intrigued me as a method to learn the fundamentals of early 3D FPS games.

                <p>
                    The life drain mechanic was inspired by DOOM (2016)’s "Glory Kill" feature, where defeating weakened enemies rewards health and ammo. Maze Walker combines these elements, using raycasting and a similar reward mechanic to create an engaging, classic FPS experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was conceived in 7 days and programmed about 16 days as part of my portfolio project for Holberton School, specifically ALX.
